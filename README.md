# Epitope Classification and Scoring Using Machine Learning

This project explores the use of machine learning techniques to classify and score epitopes within a given protein. Epitopes are regions of a protein recognized by the immune system, and their identification is essential in fields such as vaccine development and immunotherapy.

## üß™ Objectives

- Identify potential epitopes from protein sequence or structure data.
- Classify epitopes based on immunological relevance.
- Score epitopes using predictive models.
- Evaluate and compare machine learning algorithms for accuracy and interpretability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Tools

- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas, numpy
- Biopython (for sequence handling)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `data/`: Input datasets (e.g., epitope annotations, protein sequences).
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model training.
- `models/`: Trained models and evaluation results.
- `src/`: Python scripts with modular code (preprocessing, feature extraction, training).
